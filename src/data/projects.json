Browser games have been highly popular pretty much since the beginning of the internet, and since then, the power of computers has increased drastically. With the increase of power of PCs, programming technology has also improved signiffcantly and we now have far more tools to work with for pretty much anything. I would like to use the numerous different technologies, to create some sort of a web based strategy game, such as JS, HTML5 and CSS as well as others like Node, probably like two dozen different APIs, libraries and packages and also things MySQL/SQLite and possibly C++. I would like to include features like multiplayer, database support and some proper level of complexity to the game, it would be nice to make a program that I could be proud of and that others could enjoy.",
